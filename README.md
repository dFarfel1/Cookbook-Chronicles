# Cookbook Chronicles!


Cookbook chronicals, a Unity cooking game intended to educate players on nutrition, receipes, diet, and more


This study was performed for Game Programming (CS576)  as a final project in the Fall 2023 semester. The project was worked on as a group of three members.

Overview
-----------
The intuition of the project is to explore game making using Unity. Specifically, we wanted to share receipes and educate players on nutrition values and the impact of diet.

Your goal in this game is to complete the cookbook before you die (of hunger or monsters).
To complete the cookbook, you must interact with the environment and collect the materials needed for cooking. Strictly follow the recipe provided by the cookbook!

After collecting the necessary items, please bring them to the oven to cook. To submit the materials, open inventory with B, select the items you plan to drop, and press L to drop them. After dropping all the necessary items, click the cook button to combine and submit the recipe.
Roam around to find new, interactable items and learn about nutrients on the way!

Below is the user manual for controls:

To move, use WASD

To attack, left-click with the mouse

To pick up, use P

To eat, use E

To view the cookbook, use TAB, press another time to unsee it

To pause the game, use ESCAPE

To open the inventory, use B

To drop something, select it first and use L

Happy Cooking!

Repo Structure
--------------
- Assets/ - A directory of all assets used/downloaded form the Unity store
  - Assets/Scripts/ - Here is where all the coded scripts are stored, if you are interested in looking into the source code
- Packages/ - A directory listing/importing packages used in this project
- Project Settings/ - A directory that stores location, specs, and other settings
- README.md - This document

Installation
-------------
To replicate this work, simply install Unity and clone the files in this repository. Note that certain assets may need to be downloaded from the Unity asset store before it can be loaded properly.

Details/Procedures
-------------------
This work was done largely using Unity, but also included C# scripts. 
Here are some interesting aspects of this project that we want to highlight:
1. Interactive machine learning model of chickens, they run away from user using user location and mathematical models.
2. Dynamic water textures (if you can make it to the pond without starving ofcourse, you'd be able to see it yourself!)
3. Simple ray tracing using Unity's build in functions

Noticed the cute book? Our talented member Chang drew it by hand, taking inspiration from google images of books!

Results
-----------
Below are some screenshoots highlighting game play:

Future Work
-----------
Much more can be improved on as there were time constraints when this project was under development. Further ideas can be to further implement and develope.
- One idea is adding more dynamic features to the game, some ideas are listed in the issues tab of this repository.
- Future focuse area can be developement of a better world map
- Adding more recipes will enhance game experience
- More animals like fish, cow, and others can be added in future updates
- Something we wanted to work on was npcs, unfortunately  due to time constraints this was not achieved
